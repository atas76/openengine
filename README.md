# OpenEngine
Football match engine

This should be the final attempt (of many) in creating an open source football match engine. The reason for so many previous attempts (you can see them by browsing this account) was more indecisiveness and starting over with a fresh approach rather than objective 'failure'. Also I have been too ambitious with the potential outcome. As of lately, I have decided to take it easy, without ever abandoning this project as a concept. 

I will do my best to incorporate as many potential approaches possible in an incremental fashion. Starting simple without any particular expectations will do the trick in making this project the "final" edition of something that I decided to pursue as early as 2003. The most conceptually representative project in this repository is openfootie. I will be doing some archaeology from time to time for either code or 'ideas' reuse. Some of these projects might also be resurrected. But in all fairness, I should have a definitive edition just for purity's sake: an open source football match engine, "pluggable" to host applications, with the latter being a big feature/added bonus than the raison d'Ãªtre. 

The motto of this engine shall be this: don't fake output. There should be consistency in how the input (players as "agents", carrying the AI and relative attribute values, along with the team tactics) produces the output (whether that would be a 3D representation of the football match or just a plain score). Making this input - output mapping as realistic as possible should be the ultimate goal. But whatever abstraction we apply, the underlying concept should be that of consistency.
